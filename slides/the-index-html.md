# The Index Html
### Where dreams come true!
#### (and angular is declared king)

```html
<html ng-app="badassApp">
  <head>
    <title>My badass angular app</title>
  </head>
  <body ng-controller="mainCtl">

  <!-- angular.js should go here -->
  </body>
</html>
```


note:  
  * angular is built on the premise that html should play a bigger part in a dynamic
  app.
  * angular does this by adding custom elements and attributes
  * and declarative two way data binding!
